        # Component proposal: [Component name]
        Share information about the component you'd like to include in USWDS. We ask for a lot of detail, but it’s okay to start with basic information — whatever you have available. Only the fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required at this time. You can work with the community to add more detail over time.
